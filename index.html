               According to me personally "LoL" is the greatest word in history. <br>
               It stands for "laughing out loud". 
               No, it does not mean "Lots of Love" as some people might assume. <br> 
               Lol used to be used as an acronym to emphasise great amusement in chat conversations. <br>
               Nowdays there are lots of different ways to LOL.<br>
               For example, "LMAO" is great to use when you find something to be extreamly funny. <br>
               It stands for "Laughing my a** off" <br>
               Or did anyone say someting awkward that you don't know what to reply to? <br>
               Then just say lol!<br>
               It's a great coverup for when you simply can't get yourself to laugh. <br>
               Lol is a great filler word in general. <br>
               You have nothing to contribute to a vaugly amusing conversation?<br>
               LoL! <br>
               My personal favorite is the "ROFLMAO" verison. It stands for <br>
               "rolling on the floor laughing my a** off"

              Consider this a "PSA" that everyone should LoL more. <br>
              Lols makes the world a better place :')
